These domains represent specific management areas within an enterprise, providing a cohesive structure for processes, information, and applications. \n\n**Business Process Framework Domains:**\n\n* **Market/Sales:** This domain focuses on processes related to marketing and sales activities, including customer acquisition, product positioning, and sales channel management.\n* **Product:** This domain encompasses processes related to product development, management, and lifecycle.\n* **Customer:** This domain covers processes related to customer relationship management, including customer service, billing, and account management.\n* **Service:** This domain focuses on processes related to service delivery, including service design, activation, and maintenance.\n* **Resource:** This domain encompasses processes related to resource management, including network infrastructure, IT systems, and human resources.\n\n**Information Framework Domains:**\n\n* **Product & Service:** This domain defines the Aggregate Business Entities (ABEs) associated with product and service management. These ABEs represent the core data elements used by processes within the Business Process Framework.\n* **Other Domains:** Additional domains within the Information Framework may exist to address specific management areas.\n\n**Application Framework Domains:**\n\n* **Horizontals:** These domains represent horizontal application categories, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Network Management.\n* **Verticals:** These domains represent vertical application categories specific to the telecommunications industry, such as Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) and Service Assurance.\n\n**Domain Properties:**\n\n* **Encapsulation:** Domains encapsulate both operations/behavior and corporate/enterprise information relevant to the domain's business objectives.\n* **Distinguishable Share:** Domains represent a distinct portion of the enterprise's operating model.\n* **Cohesiveness:** Domains are closely related collections of processes, business entities, functions, and interfaces that work together to fulfill the domain's role within the enterprise.\n\n**Standardization and Customization:**\n\nThe ODF's domain-based approach balances standardization and customization. By using standard, reusable components, organizations can gain the benefits of standardization while still having the flexibility to customize and differentiate their services.

ODF includes the target Open Digital Architecture (ODA); incorporating a modern, flexible integration fabric (Open APIs), together with the infrastructure for binary testing of conformance for interoperability and end-to-end management. ODF also provides tools to support migration from legacy systems to ODA's modular, cloud native architecture with software components enabling IT and network capabilities over time. In short, ODF is a future-proof blueprint for service providers to deliver intelligent operations fit for the 5G and IoT era, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). The adoption of ODF enables a new style of a software market for CSPs as they evolve to become digital service providers (DSPs) one where the procurement and assembly of interoperable solutions is easier and where these solutions are substantially cheaper to deploy, integrate and upgrade. Made up of industry standard, self- describing components, they will enable systems designers to discover solutions that can be used to tmforum accelerate innovation in a \"try and buy, fail fast and cheap\" approach. Open Digital Framework marks a significant change for the DSP software market, simplifying the solutions and removing the need for large-scale customization and integration. Service providers will prioritize investment in software and technology that differentiates their business, not in the customization and integration of non- differentiating solutions. This creates opportunities for new market entrants and established vendors to unlock value-added partnerships. Collaboration across the industry will be vital to this effort. Service providers will drive the demand for these new, flexible solutions, while software vendors and solution providers will bring their essential expertise. Only through collaboration can the industry attain the required knowledge and agree the required standards and common code assets such as APIs. Working closely with the relevant standards bodies, TM Forum is the platform to drive rapid innovation in these developments and will play a critical role in igniting the market. The foundations are now in place now is the time to scale.

These solutions are characterized by a modern software-based architecture that is lightweight, decoupled, cloud-based and data and Al-driven. They will comprise software components that can be easily discovered and procured from multiple vendors, and easily integrated and deployed. Combined with a transformed culture and ways of working, such as CI/CD and DevSecOps, this new approach for telecoms software which mirrors lessons learned from hyperscale cloud providers, will enable service providers to unlock a new era of innovation and growth. To enable this radical architectural and cultural shift, TM Forum members, representing some of the world's leading service providers, software vendors, system integrators and consultants, have been collaboratively building the Open Digital Framework (ODF) - a repository of tools, architecture, code, knowledge and standards to enable this software model and a marketplace to support it. ODF offers CSPs an end-to-end migration path from legacy systems to modular, cloud native IT components, and provides a blueprint for service providers to deliver intelligent operations fit for the 5G era. The adoption of the ODF enables the procurement and assembly of solutions that are easier and cheaper to deploy, integrate and upgrade. The Open Digital Architecture, incorporating TM Forum's Open APIs and Reference Implementations will facilitate the evolution of the new software model. The successful deployment and operation of this new software model, and the marketplace approach, relies on standard robust software components being created. In the future, instead of purchasing software applications and installing them in their own data centers, CSPs will instead source on-demand capabilities implemented in software components, services and microservices via Open APIs from the marketplace hosted on cloud platforms. We envision a collaborative, industry-wide community governed by TM Forum defining the component standards, which have two dimensions: A set of industry-standard component definitions that decompose the full capabilities defined in the ODA Functional Architecture into standard software components. A standardized software-defined envelope that all components must utilize, capturing the meta-data that enables each component to be automatically deployed and managed in an operational 'Canvas'. (The implementation for the component can be proprietary and is typically defined by linking to container images in a container repository.)

The over-arching objective of the Business Process Framework is to continue to build on TM Forum's success in establishing: \u2022 An (CSP) 'industry standard' business process framework. \u2022 Common definitions to describe process elements of a CSP. \u2022 "}], "uri": "gs://tmf-documents/GB991_Core_Frameworks_Concepts_and_Principles_v21.5.pdf", "document": "projects/982845833565/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/tmf-metadata-layout-p_1715009821486/branches/0/documents/982945", "title": "GB991_Core_Frameworks_Concepts_and_Principles_v21.5"}, {"chunkInfo": [{"content": "\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nTo address these challenges, TM Forum members are leading an industry initiative to build the Open Digital Framework (ODF). ODF includes the target Open Digital Architecture (ODA); incorporating a modern, flexible integration fabric (Open APIs), together with the infrastructure for binary testing of conformance for interoperability and end-to-end management. ODF also provides tools to support migration from legacy systems to ODA's modular, cloud native architecture with software components enabling IT and network capabilities over time. In short, ODF is a future-proof blueprint for service providers to deliver intelligent operations fit for the 5G and IoT era, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). The adoption of ODF enables a new style of a software market for CSPs as they evolve to become digital service providers (DSPs) one where the procurement and assembly of interoperable solutions is easier and where these solutions are substantially cheaper to deploy, integrate and upgrade. Made up of industry standard, self- describing components, they will enable systems designers to discover solutions that can be used to tmforum accelerate innovation in a \"try and buy, fail fast and cheap\" approach. Open Digital Framework marks a significant change for the DSP software market, simplifying the solutions and removing the need for large-scale customization and integration. Service providers will prioritize investment in software and technology that differentiates their business, not in the customization and integration of non- differentiating solutions. This creates opportunities for new market entrants and established vendors to unlock value-added partnerships. Collaboration across the industry will be vital to this effort. Service providers will drive the demand for these new, flexible solutions, while software vendors and solution providers will bring their essential expertise. Only through collaboration can the industry attain the required knowledge and agree the required standards and common code assets such as APIs. Working closely with the relevant standards bodies, TM Forum is the platform to drive rapid innovation in these developments and will play a critical role in igniting the market. The foundations are now in place now is the time to scale.

These solutions are characterized by a modern software-based architecture that is lightweight, decoupled, cloud-based and data and Al-driven. They will comprise software components that can be easily discovered and procured from multiple vendors, and easily integrated and deployed. Combined with a transformed culture and ways of working, such as CI/CD and DevSecOps, this new approach for telecoms software which mirrors lessons learned from hyperscale cloud providers, will enable service providers to unlock a new era of innovation and growth. To enable this radical architectural and cultural shift, TM Forum members, representing some of the world's leading service providers, software vendors, system integrators and consultants, have been collaboratively building the Open Digital Framework (ODF) - a repository of tools, architecture, code, knowledge and standards to enable this software model and a marketplace to support it. ODF offers CSPs an end-to-end migration path from legacy systems to modular, cloud native IT components, and provides a blueprint for service providers to deliver intelligent operations fit for the 5G era. The adoption of the ODF enables the procurement and assembly of solutions that are easier and cheaper to deploy, integrate and upgrade. The Open Digital Architecture, incorporating TM Forum's Open APIs and Reference Implementations will facilitate the evolution of the new software model. The successful deployment and operation of this new software model, and the marketplace approach, relies on standard robust software components being created. In the future, instead of purchasing software applications and installing them in their own data centers, CSPs will instead source on-demand capabilities implemented in software components, services and microservices via Open APIs from the marketplace hosted on cloud platforms. We envision a collaborative, industry-wide community governed by TM Forum defining the component standards, which have two dimensions: A set of industry-standard component definitions that decompose the full capabilities defined in the ODA Functional Architecture into standard software components. A standardized software-defined envelope that all components must utilize, capturing the meta-data that enables each component to be automatically deployed and managed in an operational 'Canvas'. (The implementation for the component can be proprietary and is typically defined by linking to container images in a container repository.)
